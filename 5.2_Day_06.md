26. Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

```js
function searchInsert(nums, target) {
  let place = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    if (nums[i] === target) {
      place = i;
      return place;
    } else if (nums[i] < target) {
      place = i + 1;
    }
  }
  return place;
}

console.log(searchInsert([1, 3, 5, 6], 0));
```

27. You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

```js
function climbStairs(n) {
  let first = 0,
    second = 1;
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    next = first + second;
    first = second;
    second = next;
  }
  return next;
}
console.log(climbStairs(5));

```
